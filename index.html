<p>Lead contamination could be a main contributor to Syracuse properties being deemed unfit. About <a href= "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/syracuse-residents-activists-demand-action-lead-water-rcna180390#">26%</a> of Syracuse homes exceed federal lead levels, according to a sample from the Environmental Protection Agency. Lead exposure <a href= "https://nchh.org/resource-library/Lead_Safe_Housing_Policy_Guidance.pdf">falls under</a> the category of property maintenance. Over half of Syracuse' unfit properties had internal property maintenance issues.</p>
 
<p>The unfit property data sample ranges from Jan. 27, 2014 to Sept. 12, 2024. According to the data, 262 unfit property complaints were filed in Syracuse over the last decade. Also in recent years, Syracuse’s lead poisoning cases have steadily increased to one of the highest rates in the country, <a href= "https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/groups-seek-action-on-syracuse-lead-contaminated-drinking-water.pdf">according to</a> the National Resources Defense Council.</p>

<p>About a month ago, the NRDC drafted a <a href= "https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/groups-seek-action-on-syracuse-lead-contaminated-drinking-water.pdf">letter</a> to the city of Syracuse demanding that they address the record-high lead poisoning rates in the city. More than <a href= "https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/syracuse-ny-lead-in-water/">14,000</a> homes in Syracuse are exposed to lead, according to the NRDC.</p>
 
<p>Syracuse area codes 13204, 13205 and 13208 have both high property maintenance 
<a href= "https://data-syr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/71525e1b176e4fcba2edee8c6a590f84">complaints</a> as well as high child lead poisoning <a href= "http://www.ongov.net/health/lead/placeandracedata.html">rates</a>, according to ongov.net and syr.gov. Out of all the property maintenance complaints, 44 of them are in the zip code 13204, the most out of all area codes in Syracuse. In that zip code, 65 children tested positive for lead in their blood.</p>

<p>Debra Lewis, lead program coordinator for the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program and Healthy Homes Initiative for Onondaga County Health Department, said part of preventing children from being exposed to lead is conducting home inspections.</p>
 
<p>“The way that a health department does a home inspection is different than other kinds of housing inspections. For us, it constitutes an exposure investigation,” Lewis said. “It's rare for us to find other sources that lead to a child having an elevated lead level.”</p>
 
<p>In Onondaga County, landlords and contractors are responsible for providing a tenant with information about identifying and controlling hazards in properties built before 1978, <a href= "http://www.ongov.net/health/lead/tenants.html">according to</a> ongov.net. Lewis said that because of this rental requirement, she “hopes” that the owner will have gone through the process of inspecting the property before a tenant moves in, but that she and her team are in no way of knowing or controlling this.</p>
 
<p>Even with the inspection requirement, most properties claimed “unfit” in Syracuse were due to property maintenance issues. With the data correlation, lead poisoning could be a main part of property maintenance issues in Syracuse, which is very dangerous for children living in these properties and puts their health at risk.</p>
 
<p>“There really is no treatment,” Lewis said. “The treatment is to remove the source of exposure from the child's environment.”</p>
